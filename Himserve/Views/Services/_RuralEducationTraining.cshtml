                    <p>
                        As a result of poor rural educations, many village parents lack the skills necessary brighten their children's future. Additionally, illiteracy
                        decreases their self confidence, makes them susceptible to manipulation and reduces their options for personal progress and livelihood. HIMserve identifies individuals in communities
                        who can serve as Adult Literacy Facilitators. The ALF's are provided with the training and resources they need to help interested individuals attain literacy within their community.

                    <p>
                        HIMserve helps rural educators teaching in existing facilities to modernize their methods. Traditionally students memorize materials through rote learning.
                        As a result, little of this material is retained and students often lack the ability to apply their knowledge. The concept of participatory and experiential
                        learning is virtually unknown in village schools. Through this training program teachers learn how to actively engage their pupils to create understanding and
                        critical thinking skills. Additionally teachers are given strategies to compassionately discipline their classroom environment making learning a positive
                        experience for every child. <br />

                        Village schools throughout the Himalayas often suffer from a shortage of competent staff, resources and appropriate infrastructure. Many schools are schools by name only.
                        Many days students sit idly or return early when the few teachers there are simply fail to show up for duty. Many have lost hope of finding a solution to the education gap
                        between city and village. Empowered by the trail reconstruction project which was initiated by Ryan and Amanda Phillips in 2003, the Red Star Social Club (named after the
                        locally prevalent red star orchid) decided to break the cycle of ignorance. Parents picked up shovels and began to dig a foundation. Uncles went to the jungle to cut bamboo
                        and Aunts cooked hot lunches for all the workers. With only $300, several rolls of tin roofing, two cans of black board paint and a burlap sack full of nails, hinges and
                        handles the village built a school. In the beginning, children who had passed out of Class 4 in the failing village school were dropped back to Class 2. Even so the staff
                        had to start with Kindergarten materials.

                    Children that were 8, 9 and even 10 years old couldn't properly write their name in English or Nepali. The staff struggled for
                    several years to bring the children up to city standard and then something amazing happened. The children of Daragaon even began to surpass their counterparts in the city
                    often taking 1st and 2nd place in their higher education! The original staff taught for years uncompensated simply fueled by a passion to bring change to their region.
                    In 2011, ECTA decided that these local heroes deserved a living wage and have since supported them in their service.
                    School fees are used to expand and maintain the facility as well as buy vital resource materials ECTA invests in individuals like the teachers of Daragaon who seek to
                    "be the change they wish to see in the world.".
