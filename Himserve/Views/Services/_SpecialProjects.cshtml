                    <h2>Water Projects</h2>
                    <p>
                        In many remote villages, water access is a significant issue. It is not uncommon for villagers to have to carry all they need from a distant source. 
                        This consumes a lot of their time and energy and makes rural families less productive. Bringing fresh clean water to people's homes simultaneously improves health, 
                        agricultural capabilites and the number of animals one can raise. Given the severity of the situation, HIMserve has helped pipe sufficient water to the villages of Rambi, 
                        Aafatey and Katarey. Working hand in hand with the community as well as other partnering NGO's, these projects have helped villages to thrive rather than simply survive!

                        Upon request from communities and with proper volunteer support, HIMserve facilitates and hosts village based Medical Camps. These events reach out to unmet and untreated patients who have been unable to access the care they need. In addition to the typical on going health needs of a community, usually each camp uncovers several individuals 
                        who have been suffering from a debilitating conditions for an extended period of time. Many of these conditions can be treated with low cost simple treatments which can administered 
                        locally.

                        Village schools throughout the Himalayas often suffer from a shortage of competent staff, resources and appropriate infrastructure. Many schools are schools by name only.
                        Many days students sit idly or return early when the few teachers there are simply fail to show up for duty. Many have lost hope of finding a solution to the education gap
                        between city and village. Empowered by the trail reconstruction project which was initiated by Ryan and Amanda Phillips in 2003, the Red Star Social Club (named after the
                        locally prevalent red star orchid) decided to break the cycle of ignorance. Parents picked up shovels and began to dig a foundation. Uncles went to the jungle to cut bamboo
                        and Aunts cooked hot lunches for all the workers. With only $300, several rolls of tin roofing, two cans of black board paint and a burlap sack full of nails, hinges and
                        handles the village built a school. In the beginning, children who had passed out of Class 4 in the failing village school were dropped back to Class 2. Even so the staff
                        had to start with Kindergarten materials.

                    Children that were 8, 9 and even 10 years old couldn't properly write their name in English or Nepali. The staff struggled for
                    several years to bring the children up to city standard and then something amazing happened. The children of Daragaon even began to surpass their counterparts in the city
                    often taking 1st and 2nd place in their higher education! The original staff taught for years uncompensated simply fueled by a passion to bring change to their region.
                    In 2011, ECTA decided that these local heroes deserved a living wage and have since supported them in their service.
                    School fees are used to expand and maintain the facility as well as buy vital resource materials ECTA invests in individuals like the teachers of Daragaon who seek to
                    "be the change they wish to see in the world.".
