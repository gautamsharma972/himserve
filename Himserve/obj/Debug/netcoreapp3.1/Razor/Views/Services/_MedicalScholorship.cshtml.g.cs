            WriteLiteral(@"lso a heart to serve their community will bridge
                        the gap between urban and rural health care. Village students do not quickly forget the conditions of their upbringing and are accustomed to the rigors of
                        daily life in isolated regions. They carry in their hearts compassion for those living in remote regions. They have also “walked in those shoes”.
                        These students naturally understand the need for quality health care and devoted practitioners at the village level. Despite these assets,
                        few village students are able to access medical education due to inequitable competition by urban/affluent students. Village parents in the Himalayas,
                        have to literally climb a mountain to even put their children through middle and high school. Many pay for school fees one liter of milk or one sack of
                        potatoes at a time. Not even counting this toil, in the end parents will climb a m");

                        education is paid for with countless drops of sweat. Village students face equally daunting obstacles. While city students arrive at school fresh, having only a
                        short walk or bus ride, village students arrive exhausted after walking, sometimes hours, through valleys and over passes. Just as the best doctors remain in the
                        city, the best teachers remain there as well depriving rural students of quality education. All of these factors compound to make it nearly impossible for a
                        village student to gain a seat in a Medical College… so the cycle continues year after year. Rural PHC’s remain empty and villages bear the toll in the form
                        of poor community health. Despite all these challenges, many promising and aspiring village students try year after year to gain a seat. ECTA recognizes that

                        send these promising students to Medical School through the Dr. Paul Brand Medical Scholarship. In becoming a sponsored scholar, students will agree to a minimum
                        of 5 years of service in a rural PHC’s after graduation. Additionally, ECTA will augment their medical education with a holistic mentoring program. This program
